# Simple Social Network

This repository implements a simple social network with three core components:

## Main Components

1. **Person.java**  
   Represents an individual user within the social network. This class encapsulates basic information and behaviors of a person, such as name, unique identifier, and personal attributes.

2. **User.java**  
   Extends or utilizes `Person.java` to manage user-specific features like authentication, profile management, and user interactions within the platform.

3. **Network.java**  
   Serves as the backbone of the social network. This class manages the collection of users, relationships (friendships, followers), and the overall connectivity between users.

## Overview

- The repository is structured around the three main classes listed above, which together provide the foundation for modeling a social network.
- Each class has a distinct responsibility, ensuring separation of concerns and modularity.
- The design allows for future extensions, such as adding messaging, posts, or advanced relationship types.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and explore the three main files:
- `Person.java`
- `User.java`
- `Network.java`

You can compile and test the classes using your preferred Java IDE or the command line.
